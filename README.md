# Android-NewsApi

Description:
App displays multiple news stories extracted from API supported by Guardian. Touching each story would take you to the url of the story, so user can access full story through their phone's browser.  



Motivation:
The intensive Nanodegree on Android Basics by Google on Udacity ensured that this project did not involve the use of external libraries.

This was my first project using APIs where I had to manually ensure that JSON data was being parsed correctly, and the desired data was extracted with accuracy.
