# NewsApi App

## Description:
App displays multiple news stories extracted from Guardian API. Tapping on each story would enable user access full story through their phone's browser.  



## Motivation:
The intensive Nanodegree in Android Basics by Google on Udacity ensured that this project did not involve the use of external libraries.

This was my first project using APIs where I had to manually ensure that JSON data was being parsed, and the desired data was extracted with accuracy.
